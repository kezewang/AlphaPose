## FAQ
### test-pose.h5 not found
**Q:** - I get an error similar to: `IOError: Unable to open file (Unable to open file: name = '..../AlphaPose/examples/results/pose/test-pose.h5`.

**A**: test-pose.h5 is an intermediate file generated by our program. So the most possible problem is that the program is not installed correctly. Check if torch or tensorflow(>1.2) are installed, see [#10](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/issues/10) for instructions for installing torch properly. Also, check the error log and see if there are errors like **Q3**.

**Q:** - I get an error similar to: `IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '..../AlphaPose/examples/results/POSE/alpha-pose-results-forvis.json'`.

**A**: Same as **Q1**

### module 'xx' not found:No LuaRocks module found for 'xx'
